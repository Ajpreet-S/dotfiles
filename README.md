## dotfiles
My Ubuntu dotfiles. For when I want to install a Linux distro on any other machine or lose my laptop for some reason.

### Packages
neovim - People say this is like Vim's cooler brother.
autojump - Makes navigating through directories easier.
fzf - File searching utility.
i3wm - Windows manager.
compton - Cool transparency and transition effects I use for i3wm.
mysql-server - Pretty self explanatory.
